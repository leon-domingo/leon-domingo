## Developer

Curious developer and enthusiast of **the WWW** universe, looking for a company's "mission/vision" (what they're trying to achieve and for whom) and culture (what they think about the people inside) I can feel aligned with.

I'm in love with **open-source projects** which give us a great support to create useful things with a low cost and full transparency. (Almost) every tool I use is open source (Linux, Python, PostgreSQL, VSCode, and so on) and I (usually) do not like propietary solutions (Oracle, SQL Server, Windows, etc) because of the obligation to adopt another set of private related technologies from the same company (most of the time).

I'm pretty focused on **JavaScript**-related technologies (including **Typescript**): **React** or **Vue** for the front, and **Node/Express** for the backend.

I love **Python** and the whole living ecosystem around it. Great work of a lot of people. Great on-line resources and awesome productivity.

Testing (and playing with) new technologies, as they come up, is something I like a lot.
