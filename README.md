# León Domingo
## Developer

Curious developer and enthusiast of **the WWW** universe, looking for a company's "mission/vision" (what they're trying to achieve and for whom) and culture (what they think about the people inside) I can feel aligned with.

I'm in love with **open-source projects** which give us a great support to create useful things with a low cost. (Almost) every tool I use is open source (Linux, Python, PostgreSQL, VSCode, etc, etc) and I (usually) do not like propietary solutions (oracle, sql server, windows, etc) because of the obligation to adopt another set of private related technologies from the same company (most of the time).

I love **Python** and the whole living ecosystem around it. Great work of a lot of people. Great on-line resources and awesome productivity.

I'm also focused on **JavaScript**-related technologies, mostly for the frontend: **React**, **Vue**, with **Python** or **Node/Express** as the backend.

Testing (and playing with) new technologies, as they come up, is something I like a lot. **Golang** or **Blockchain** are areas where I want to get better in the mid term.
